# React useState Form – Simple Controlled Form Example

A beginner-friendly React application built with **Create React App** that demonstrates **state management using `useState`**. The app allows users to input their **name** and **age**, submit the form, display the submitted values, and reset the form.

---

## Overview

This project illustrates how React handles **form inputs** and **state updates** in real time. It is ideal for beginners who want to understand:

* React state management with `useState`
* Controlled components (`value` + `onChange`)
* Form submission handling
* Updating and displaying state dynamically
* Resetting form inputs after submission
* Basic component-based UI structure

---

## Key Features

* **Controlled Inputs:** Name and age fields synced with state
* **Form Submission Handling:** Displays submitted data on submit
* **Form Reset:** Clears input fields after submission
* **Dynamic Display:** Shows submitted data immediately below the form
* **Clean UI:** Minimal and readable styling using CSS
* **Beginner-Friendly:** Easy to understand and modify
